      When creating or editing Cursor rules:

      1. Frontmatter must come FIRST, followed by content:
         ```markdown
         ---
         alwaysApply: true
         description: Your description here
         ---
         
         # Your Rule Title
         
         Your rule content goes here, after the frontmatter.
         ```

      2. Frontmatter structure:
         - Must be enclosed in `---` markers
         - Must be at the very top of the file
         - Contains metadata properties only
         - No rule content should be inside frontmatter

      3. Content structure:
         - Must come AFTER the frontmatter
         - Can include markdown formatting
         - Can reference files using `[filename](mdc:filename)` syntax
         - Should be descriptive and helpful

      4. Common mistakes to avoid:
         - Putting rule content inside frontmatter
         - Missing content after frontmatter
         - Incorrect frontmatter syntax
