# Relations with specs

Git commits can relate to their specifications in various ways:

- Implements: They can implement a spec
- Updates: They update a previous implementation to the updated version of the current spec
- Fixes: They can fix a spec that was no longer being met
- Refactors: They can clean up code for an implementation of a spec
- Documents: They can document the particular implementation of a spec
- Tests: They can test that the spec requirements are met
