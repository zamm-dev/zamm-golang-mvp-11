# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature has been successfully implemented to add debug message logging capability to the bubbletea-based interactive CLI application. The logging system captures all bubbletea messages and dumps them to a file for debugging purposes, following the approach described in the leg100 blog post. This helps developers debug the interactive TUI components by providing visibility into the message flow and state changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enable debug logging for bubbletea messages, so that I can troubleshoot issues with the interactive CLI components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL capture all bubbletea messages to a log file
2. WHEN the application starts with debug mode THEN the system SHALL create a debug log file in a predictable location
3. WHEN messages are logged THEN the system SHALL include timestamp and message type information
4. WHEN the application exits THEN the system SHALL properly close the debug log file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to control when debug logging is active, so that I can enable it only when needed for troubleshooting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a debug flag is provided THEN the system SHALL enable message logging
2. WHEN no debug flag is provided THEN the system SHALL run normally without logging overhead
3. WHEN debug logging is disabled THEN the system SHALL not create log files or impact performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want debug logs to be stored in an accessible location, so that I can easily find and analyze them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL create log files in ~/.zamm/logs directory
2. WHEN multiple instances run THEN the system SHALL handle log file conflicts appropriately
3. WHEN log files are created THEN the system SHALL use a clear naming convention with timestamps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the debug logging to integrate seamlessly with the existing bubbletea program structure, so that it doesn't disrupt the current application flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug logging is added THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality
2. WHEN the tea.Program is created THEN the system SHALL optionally wrap it with debug capabilities
3. WHEN debug mode is disabled THEN the system SHALL have no performance impact on the normal operation
