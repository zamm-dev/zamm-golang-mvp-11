# Node Creation/Editing Flow

There should be a single flow for node creation and editing.

During creation, the screens should be presented in the following order:

1. Screen to select what node type to create
2. Screen to enter generic node details (title and description of node)
3. Screen to enter type-specific details, if any (e.g. for implementation nodes, offer a form for entering Git repo details)
