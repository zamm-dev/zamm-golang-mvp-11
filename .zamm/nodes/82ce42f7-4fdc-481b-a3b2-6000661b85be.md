# Path hierarchy

Nodes with children use the slug as folder name with README.md (e.g. `docs/architecture/README.md`), leaf nodes use the slug as the filename itself (e.g. `docs/architecture/storage-module.md`). This allows the documentation to be easily browsable inside of the usual GitHub interface.

Root node should live directly under `docs`.
