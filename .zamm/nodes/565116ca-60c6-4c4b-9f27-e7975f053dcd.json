  "content": "There should be a variable that tracks the currently \"active node\". The active node will be the same as \"current node\" until the user starts pressing the down button and a child spec is selected, at which point the first child spec will be the current active node. This will remain the case until the user presses \"enter\", which will change the current node to the child node and cause the new current node to be the active node again, or the user presses `esc`, which will simply set the active node back to the current node. If the user presses `esc` while the active node is the current node, then the current node should be set to the parent and the new current node will be the active node again. \n\nIf the user presses arrow key down while the list is not in focus, then the list should be set in focus and the first child element of the list selected \n\nThis means that child nodes in the list should no longer be selected upon init. Instead, we should wait until the user selects a node. \n\nThe active node should be displayed in bold blue. If the current node is the active node, that means the entire left of the screen should be styled according to the bold blue of the project-wide highlight style. If a child node is the active node, that means the entire right of the screen should be bold blue, and the child's position in the list should be bold blue.",
