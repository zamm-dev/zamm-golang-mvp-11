# Node file format

Each node will be stored as a Markdown file with:

- The node title as the level 1 heading
- The node description as the Markdown content
- All other node metadata in the frontmatter

If that node has any children, we should also append a horizontal divider line and then a list of links to each of its child specs within the repo. When reading node data from its Markdown file, we should ignore the last divider line and all content after it.

> [!NOTE]
> The links to the child markdown files should be paths relative to the project root. However, this means prepending a `/` slash in front of the paths, or else VS Code (and probably GitHub too) will take this to mean the path relative from the current file, not relative to the project root.
