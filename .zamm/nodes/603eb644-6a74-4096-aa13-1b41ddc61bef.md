# Slug editor

This should be its own screen instead of an overlay.

If the autogenerated slug is more than three words long, then we should ask a cheap Anthropic LLM for help coming up with a slug that's at most three words long. In this case, we reduce latency by initializing this slug editor screen with an empty slug, while using a `tea.Cmd` to popoulate the text field with the LLM response. If the user has edited any of the text, then we display the LLM response on a separate line instead of overwriting the user edit.

Any errors with the LLM call should be surfaced here.
