# `organize`

The `organize` command puts a node into its proper place in the main project hierarchy. For example, instead of being placed at `.zamm/nodes/<UUID>.md`, it would be placed at a location such as `documentation/architecture/storage-layer/zamm-directory-layout.md`. This allows generic AI coding agents to easily discover these files themselves.

If no argument is provided, the command should organize all nodes. If a node ID is provided, the command should organize only that node and no other -- not any in its subtree.
