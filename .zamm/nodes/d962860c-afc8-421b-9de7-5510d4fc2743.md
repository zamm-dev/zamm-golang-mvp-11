title: Bubble list component will need to handle list filtering updates
type: specification
---

When using Golang's bubble list package, note that you have to [handle `list.filterMatchesMsg` tea command updates](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/issues/155#issuecomment-964204297) or else the filtering will not work properly.

Symptoms include the TUI responding to filtering text input without any of the list items actually being filtered out.
