title: Successful operations should not force user acknowledgment
type: specification
---

For example, there should not be a separate screen forcing the user to acknowledge that the operation succeeded. Instead, the user should simply be shown the result of the successful operation.

For example, *that* means that if the user has just finished creating or editing a node, the user should be taken to the updated version of that node.
