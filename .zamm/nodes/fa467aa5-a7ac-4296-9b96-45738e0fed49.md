# Node slugs

Because of the hierarchical nature of project documentation, there will be slugs generated for each node.

Because these need to be consistent, the `slug` field is added to the NodeBase struct and Node interface with getter/setter methods.

> [!NOTE]
> If we're organizing only a single node, then only the slug for that node should be generated.
